# ShellScripting
This project contains a lot of scripts to automatize tasks like program installation and configuration.
The scripts can be obtained from the scripts folder.

# Running the scripts
To run any of the scripts it's necessary enable run permition as follows:
sudo chmod u+x [script_name].sh

Where [script_name] should be replaced by the correct script file name.

Then, to run it, use the command:
sudo ./[script_name].sh

The script should be executed by root user once it runs configuration and installation process in it.
